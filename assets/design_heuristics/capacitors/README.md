# Capacitor Design Heuristics

This folder contains design guidelines and selection criteria for capacitors in power electronics and signal applications.

## Recommended Document Topics:

### 1. **Capacitor Type Selection**
- MLCC vs Electrolytic vs Polymer comparison
- ESR and ripple current considerations
- Temperature coefficient characteristics
- Voltage derating guidelines

### 2. **Application-Specific Guidelines**
- Input/output filtering requirements
- Decoupling and bypass applications
- Energy storage considerations
- Ripple current handling

### 3. **Design Considerations**
- Capacitance variation with voltage and temperature
- Self-resonant frequency limitations
- Mounting and layout considerations
- Lifetime and reliability factors
