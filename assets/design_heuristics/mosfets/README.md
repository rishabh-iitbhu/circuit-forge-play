# MOSFET Design Heuristics

This folder contains design guidelines and selection criteria for MOSFETs in power electronics applications.

## Recommended Document Topics:

### 1. **Switching MOSFETs Selection**
- Gate charge considerations (Qg, Qgd, Qgs)
- On-resistance (RDS(on)) vs voltage rating trade-offs
- Switching speed and efficiency optimization
- Thermal considerations and package selection

### 2. **Application-Specific Guidelines**
- Buck converter MOSFET selection
- Synchronous rectifier considerations
- High-frequency switching optimization
- Low-side vs high-side driver requirements

### 3. **Design Trade-offs**
- Efficiency vs cost analysis
- Thermal management requirements
- Gate drive design considerations
- Parasitic inductance minimization
